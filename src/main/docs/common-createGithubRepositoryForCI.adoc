We will need to place the Grails application on GitHub so that the CI can access it.

Proceed to GitHub and follow the directions to https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/[create a new repository].

NOTE: When creating the repo, make it public. Option not to create a LICENSE and .gitignore. We are importing an existing code base so we want to avoid conflicts.

Import the code into the repo on GitHub by executing the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
> git init
> git add .
> git commit -m "first commit"
> git remote add origin <Your repo URL>
> git push -u origin master
----
