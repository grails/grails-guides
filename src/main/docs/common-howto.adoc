To get started do the following:

* link:https://github.com/{githubSlug}/archive/master.zip[Download] and unzip the source

or 

* Clone the https://git-scm.com/[Git] repository: +
`git clone https://github.com/{githubSlug}.git`

The Micronaut guides repositories contain two folders:

* `initial`  Initial project. Often a simple Micronaut app with some additional code to give you a head-start.
* `complete` A completed example. It is the result of working through the steps presented by the guide and applying those changes to the `initial` folder.

To complete the guide, go to the `initial` folder 

* `cd` into `{githubSlug}/initial`

and follow the instructions in the next sections.

TIP: You can go right to the **completed example** if you `cd` into `{githubSlug}/complete`
